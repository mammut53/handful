# Handful

Handful is a visual client-side Minecraft mod that displays the entire stack in entities' hands, just as the items would appear on the ground. Gone are the days of seeing a single item for a big stack - now you can truly appreciate your spoils in full!

## Key Features
- Full Stack Visuals: Whether it’s 2 items or 64, you’ll see them the same way those items would appear on the ground, just in your hand.
- Selective Display: Only 2D items are affected, so blocks remain unchanged for the best visual results. 

Check out the images to see how much more immersive your stacks can look.
Upgrade your item-viewing game with Handful, and never settle for a lonely item again!
